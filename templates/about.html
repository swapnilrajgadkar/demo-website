                          <h3>Hello, I'm Swapnil Rajgadkar</h3>
                          <p>I have completed my Electrical Engineering from Government College Of Engineering,karad.</p>
                          <h3>Professional Life</h3>
                          <p>I began my career in the field of Affiliate Marketing, where I gained valuable experience in online marketing strategies and tactics.
                            As I progressed in my role, I became interested in the technical side of the industry and decided to pursue further education in programming.<br>
                            I dedicated myself to learn the fundamentals of programming. Through hard work and determination, I was able to develop my skills in Python and other programming languages.<br>
                            I then used my new skills to pivot into a career as a Python developer, where I have been able to apply my knowledge.<br>
                            I am always looking for ways to learn and grow as a developer, and 
                            I am excited to continue exploring new technologies and techniques as I progress in my career.
                          </p>
                          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                          <p>
                            Staying fit and healthy is important to me and I enjoy challenging myself at the Gym.<br>
                            I am an avid Music lover and music has the power to lift my mood and inspire me.<br>
                            Also I have always been a fan of cricket, and playing the game is one of my favorite pastimes.
